## Project History

OrdLite.io was the first Ordinals explorer for the Litecoin blockchain. It provided a platform for users to explore, view, and inscribe data onto Litecoin.

## What are Litecoin Ordinals?

Litecoin Ordinals are a way to create unique digital artifacts, similar to NFTs, by inscribing data (like images, text, or other files) onto individual lites-the smallest unit of Litecoin. This process creates a permanent, immutable record on the Litecoin blockchain. An explorer like OrdLite allows users to view and interact with these inscriptions.

## Key Features

*   **Explore Inscriptions:** Search for Litecoin Ordinals by their ID, block, or address.
*   **Seamless Inscribing:** Featured a direct BTCPayServer integration, allowing users to easily inscribe their own data.
*   **Real-Time Feed:** Displayed a live feed of the most recent inscriptions on the network.
*   **Detailed Views:** Provided detailed information for each inscription, including its content, metadata, and transaction history.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Payments:** BTCPayServer
