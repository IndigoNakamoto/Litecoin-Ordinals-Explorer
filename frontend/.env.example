# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local (Next.js convention) and fill in your actual values.

# URL of the backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3001/api" # Adjust if your backend runs on a different port or path

# Example: Public key for a third-party service (e.g., Stripe, Google Analytics)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=""

# Add any other environment variables required by the frontend application below
# Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.
# Other variables (without the prefix) are only available in Node.js environments (e.g., API routes, getServerSideProps).
